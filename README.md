# Code-Golf

A collection of my solutions to problems on
[code.golf](https://code.golf).

## Compiling

For compiling the C golfs, use [tcc](https://www.bellard.org/tcc/).

The JavaScript golfs need to be wrapped in a function in order to be run
by NodeJS or any JavaScript engine.

For Rust, just use `rustc`.
